This paper presents a framework for live video analysis in which the behaviors of surveillance subjects are described using a vocabulary learned from recurrent motion patterns, for real-time characterization and prediction of future activities, as well as the detection of abnormalities. The repetitive nature of object trajectories is utilized to automatically build activity models in a 3-stage hierarchical learning process. Interesting nodes are learned through Gaussian mixture modeling, connecting routes formed through trajectory clustering, and spatio-temporal dynamics of activities probabilistically encoded using hidden Markov models. Activity models are adapted to small temporal variations in an online fashion using maximum likelihood regression and new behaviors are discovered from a periodic retraining for long-term monitoring. Extensive evaluation on various data sets, typically missing from other work, demonstrates the efficacy and generality of the proposed framework for surveillance-based activity analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory clustering method to discover spatial and temporal travel patterns in a traffic network. The study focuses on identifying spatially distinct traffic flow groups using trajectory clustering and investigating temporal traffic patterns of each spatial group. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a systematic framework for clustering and classifying vehicle trajectory data, which does not require a pre-processing step known as map-matching and directly applies to trajectory data without requiring the information on the underlying road network. The framework consists of four steps: similarity measurement, trajectory clustering, generation of cluster representative subsequences, and trajectory classification. First, we propose the use of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two vehicle trajectories as their similarity measure, assuming that the extent to which vehicles' routes overlap indicates the level of closeness and relatedness as well as potential interactions between these vehicles. We then extend a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to incorporate the LCS-based distance in our trajectory clustering problem. The output of the proposed clustering approach is a few spatially distinct traffic stream clusters, which together provide an informative and succinct representation of major network traffic streams. Next, we introduce the notion of cluster representative subsequence (CRS), which reflects dense road segments shared by trajectories belonging to a given traffic stream cluster, and present the procedure of generating a set of CRSs by merging the pairwise LCSs via hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The CRSs are then used in the trajectory classification step to measure the similarity between a new trajectory and a cluster. The proposed framework is demonstrated using actual vehicle trajectory data collected from New York City, USA. A simple experiment was performed to illustrate the use of the proposed spatial traffic stream clustering in application areas such as network-level traffic flow pattern analysis and travel time reliability analysis.},

First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for detecting nonconforming trajectories of objects as they pass through a scene. Existing methods mostly use spatial features to solve this problem. Using only spatial information is not adequate; we need to take into consideration velocity and curvature information of a trajectory along with the spatial information for an elegant solution. Our method has the ability to distinguish between objects traversing spatially dissimilar paths, or objects traversing spatially proximal paths but having different spatio-temporal characteristics. The method consists of a path building training phase and a testing phase. During the training phase, we use graph-cuts for clustering the trajectories, where the Hausdorff distance metric is used to calculate the edge weights. Each cluster represents a path. An envelope boundary and an average trajectory are computed for each path. During the testing phase we use three features for trajectory matching in a hierarchical fashion. The first feature measures the spatial similarity while the second feature compares the velocity characteristics of trajectories. Finally, the curvature features capture discontinuities in velocity, acceleration, and position of the trajectory. We use real-world pedestrian sequences to demonstrate the practicality of our method.},

In this paper, we propose an effective trajectory clustering framework in which a coarse-to-fine strategy is taken. Our framework consists of four stages: trajectory smoothing, feature extraction, trajectory coarse clustering and trajectory fine clustering. Wavelet decomposition is imposed on raw trajectories to reduce noise in the trajectory smoothing stage. Besides the commonly used positional feature, a novel feature called trajectory directional histogram is proposed to describe the statistic directional distribution of a trajectory in the feature extraction stage. Both coarse clustering and fine clustering are based on a novel graph-theoretic clustering algorithm called dominant-set clustering, but they deal with different trajectory features. Experiments in our pre-labeled trajectory database demonstrate that the proposed trajectory clustering framework possesses a very high accuracy},

abstract = {Lane detection is a crucial process in video-based transportationmonitoring system. This paper proposes a novel method to detect the lane center via rapid extraction and high accuracy clustering of vehicle motion trajectories. First, we use the activity map to realize automatically the extraction of road region, the calibration of dynamic camera, and the setting of three virtual detecting lines. Secondly, the three virtual detecting lines and a local background model with traffic flow feedback are used to extract and group vehicle feature points in unit of vehicle. Then, the feature point groups are described accurately by edge weighted dynamic graph andmodified by a motion-similarityKalman filter during the sparse feature point tracking.Aſter obtaining the vehicle trajectories, arough k-means incremental clustering with Hausdorff distance is designed to realize the rapid online extraction of lane center with high accuracy. The use of rough set reduces effectively the accuracy decrease, which results from the trajectories that run irregularly. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can detect lane center position efficiently, the affected time of subsequent tasks can be reduced obviously, and the safety of traffic surveillance systems can be enhanced significantly. 1.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach for mining lane-level road network information from low-precision vehicle GPS trajectories (MLIT), which includes the number and turn rules of traffic lanes based on na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian classification. First, the proposed method (MLIT) uses an adaptive density optimization method to remove outliers from the raw GPS trajectories based on their space-time distribution and density clustering. Second, MLIT acquires the number of lanes in two steps. The first step establishes a na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian classifier according to the trace features of the road plane and road profiles and the real number of lanes, as found in the training samples. The second step confirms the number of lanes using test samples in reference to the na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian classifier using the known trace features of test sample. Third, MLIT infers the turn rules of each lane through tracking GPS trajectories. Experiments were conducted using the GPS trajectories of taxis in Wuhan, China. Compared with human-interpreted results, the automatically generated lane-level road network information was demonstrated to be of higher quality in terms of displaying detailed road networks with the number of lanes and turn rules of each lane.},

This planner addresses the particular problem of probabilistic collision avoidance for autonomous road vehicles that are required to safely interact, in close proximity, with other vehicles with unknown intentions. The presented path planner utilizes an efficient spline based trajectory representation and fast but accurate collision probability bounds to simultaneously optimize multiple continuous contingency paths in real-time. These collision probability bounds are efficient enough for real- time evaluation, yet accurate enough to allow for practical close- proximity driving behaviors such as passing an obstacle vehicle in an adjacent lane. An obstacle trajectory clustering algorithm is also presented to enable the path planner to scale to multiple- obstacle scenarios. Simulation results show that the contingency planner allows for a more aggressive driving style than non- contingency based approaches without compromising the overall safety of the robot.},

The system defined utilises a two-phase approach to modelling the scene. In the transitional phase, a dominant set-based graphical clustering approach is applied to understand the current scene structure from trajectory groupings, whereas the operational phase analyses the trajectories in real-time to detect anomalies such as u-turns, wrong-way or erratic drivers based on the acquired model of the scene structure and normal traffic patterns. In addition, the concept of dynamic traffic flow analysis is utilised to identify and remember temporary additions and removals of paths due to construction and accidents, as well as permanent road structure changes. An intuitive equal-arc-length sampling is applied to extract only the spatial information from the trajectory comparisons, since the spatial characteristics alone are sufficient for road structure understanding. A distance metric is developed to measure spatial difference and directional change of the path with entrance and exit awareness. Results for a publicly available dataset are provided, demonstrating that the method can efficiently model the scene, detect anomalies and capture both temporary and permanent scene reconstructions.},

abstract = {—Intelligent vision-based traffic surveillance systems are assuming an increasingly important role in highway moni- toring and road management schemes. This paper describes a low-level object tracking system that produces accurate vehicle motion trajectories that can be further analyzed to detect lane centers and classify lane types. Accompanying techniques for indexing and retrieval of anomalous trajectories are also derived. The predictive trajectory merge-and-split algorithm is used to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and incorporates a Kalman filter that is used to perform vehicle track- ing. The resulting motion trajectories are modeled using variable low-degree polynomials. A K-means clustering technique on the coefficient space can be used to obtain approximate lane centers. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes can be removed using robust estimation techniques based on Random SampleConsensus (RANSAC). Through the use of nonmetric distance functions and a simple directional indicator, highway lanes can be classified into one of the following categories: entry, exit, primary, or secondary. Experimental results are presented to show the real-time applica- tion of this approach to multiple views obtained by an uncalibrated pan–tilt–zoom traffic camera monitoring the junction of two busy intersecting highways},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},

To cutback on PCA computation during indexing, we first segment the trajectories into atomic subtrajectories using a curvature zero-crossing based approach followed by clustering of these subtrajectories. A two-level PCA operation with coarse-to-fine retrieval for query trajectory is then performed to generate retrieval results. Our experimental results show that our global PCA based approach performs better when input query trajectory is of similar length compared to the matching trajectories in the database. However, when partial trajectories are posed as queries our segmented trajectory based approach provides superior results for all precision-recall ratios.},

abstract = {Road scene analysis is a challenging problem that has applications in autonomous navigation of vehicles. An integral component of this system is the robust detection and tracking of lane markings. It is a hard problem primarily due to large appearance variations in lane markings caused by factors such as occlusion (traffic on the road), shadows (from objects like trees), and changing lighting conditions of the scene (transition from day to night). In this paper, we address these issues through a learn- ing-based approach using visual inputs froma camera mounted in front of a vehicle. We propose the following: 1) a pixel-hierarchy feature descriptor to model the contextual information shared by lane markings with the surrounding road region; 2) a robust boost- ing algorithm to select relevant contextual features for detecting lane markings; and 3) particle filters to track the lane markings, without knowledge of vehicle speed, by assuming the lane mark- ings to be static through the video sequence and then learning the possible road scene variations from the statistics of tracked model parameters. We investigate the effectiveness of our algorithm on challenging daylight and night-time road video sequences.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel lane detection algorithm for visual traffic surveillance applications under the auspice of intelligent transportation systems. Traditional lane detection methods for vehicle navigation typically use spatial masks to isolate instantaneous lane information from on-vehicle camera images. When surveillance is concerned, complete lane and multiple lane information is essential for tracking vehicles and monitoring lane change frequency from overhead cameras, where traditional methods become inadequate. The algorithm presented in this paper extracts complete multiple lane information by utilizing prominent orientation and length features of lane markings and curb structures to discriminate against other minor features. Essentially, edges are first extracted from the background of a traffic sequence, then thinned and approximated by straight lines. From the resulting set of straight lines, orientation and length discriminations are carried out three-dimensionally with the aid of two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate transformation and K-means clustering. By doing so, edges with strong orientation and length affinity are retained and clustered, while short and isolated edges are eliminated. Overall, the merits of this algorithm are as follows. First, it works well under practical visual surveillance conditions. Second, using K-means for clustering offers a robust approach. Third, the algorithm is efficient as it only requires one image frame to determine the road center lines. Fourth, it computes multiple lane information simultaneously. Fifth, the center lines determined are accurate enough for the intended application.},
