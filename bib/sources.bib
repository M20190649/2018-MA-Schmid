abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory clustering method to discover spatial and temporal travel patterns in a traffic network. The study focuses on identifying spatially distinct traffic flow groups using trajectory clustering and investigating temporal traffic patterns of each spatial group. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a systematic framework for clustering and classifying vehicle trajectory data, which does not require a pre-processing step known as map-matching and directly applies to trajectory data without requiring the information on the underlying road network. The framework consists of four steps: similarity measurement, trajectory clustering, generation of cluster representative subsequences, and trajectory classification. First, we propose the use of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two vehicle trajectories as their similarity measure, assuming that the extent to which vehicles' routes overlap indicates the level of closeness and relatedness as well as potential interactions between these vehicles. We then extend a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to incorporate the LCS-based distance in our trajectory clustering problem. The output of the proposed clustering approach is a few spatially distinct traffic stream clusters, which together provide an informative and succinct representation of major network traffic streams. Next, we introduce the notion of cluster representative subsequence (CRS), which reflects dense road segments shared by trajectories belonging to a given traffic stream cluster, and present the procedure of generating a set of CRSs by merging the pairwise LCSs via hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The CRSs are then used in the trajectory classification step to measure the similarity between a new trajectory and a cluster. The proposed framework is demonstrated using actual vehicle trajectory data collected from New York City, USA. A simple experiment was performed to illustrate the use of the proposed spatial traffic stream clustering in application areas such as network-level traffic flow pattern analysis and travel time reliability analysis.},

In particular, labelled paths provide an efficient means for compressing the trajectory data for logging purposes. In addition, the model can be used to compute a probabilistic prediction of the pedestrian's location many time steps ahead, and to aid the recognition of unusual behaviour identified as atypical object motion.},

abstract = {High-level semantic understanding of vehicle motion behaviors is often based on vehicle motion trajectory clustering. In this paper, we propose an effective trajectory clustering framework in which a coarse-to-fine strategy is taken. Our framework consists of four stages: trajectory smoothing, feature extraction, trajectory coarse clustering and trajectory fine clustering. Wavelet decomposition is imposed on raw trajectories to reduce noise in the trajectory smoothing stage. Besides the commonly used positional feature, a novel feature called trajectory directional histogram is proposed to describe the statistic directional distribution of a trajectory in the feature extraction stage. Both coarse clustering and fine clustering are based on a novel graph-theoretic clustering algorithm called dominant-set clustering, but they deal with different trajectory features. Experiments in our pre-labeled trajectory database demonstrate that the proposed trajectory clustering framework possesses a very high accuracy},

We present a robust lane-detection-and-tracking algorithm to deal with challenging scenarios such as a lane curvature, worn lane markings, lane changes, and emerging, ending, merging, and splitting lanes. We first present a comparative study to find a good real-time lane-marking classifier. Once detection is done, the lane markings are grouped into lane-boundary hypotheses. We group left and right lane boundaries separately to effectively handle merging and splitting lanes. A fast and robust algorithm, based on random-sample consensus and particle filtering, is proposed to generate a large number of hypotheses in real time. The generated hypotheses are evaluated and grouped based on a probabilistic framework. The suggested framework effectively combines a likelihood-based object-recognition algorithm with a Markov-style process (tracking) and can also be applied to general-part-based object-tracking problems. An experimental result on local streets and highways shows that the suggested algorithm is very reliable.},

This paper proposes a novel method to detect the lane center via rapid extraction and high accuracy clustering of vehicle motion trajectories. First, we use the activity map to realize automatically the extraction of road region, the calibration of dynamic camera, and the setting of three virtual detecting lines. Secondly, the three virtual detecting lines and a local background model with traffic flow feedback are used to extract and group vehicle feature points in unit of vehicle. Then, the feature point groups are described accurately by edge weighted dynamic graph andmodified by a motion-similarityKalman filter during the sparse feature point tracking.Aſter obtaining the vehicle trajectories, arough k-means incremental clustering with Hausdorff distance is designed to realize the rapid online extraction of lane center with high accuracy. The use of rough set reduces effectively the accuracy decrease, which results from the trajectories that run irregularly. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can detect lane center position efficiently, the affected time of subsequent tasks can be reduced obviously, and the safety of traffic surveillance systems can be enhanced significantly. 1.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel optimization based path planner capable of planning multiple contingency paths to directly account for uncertainties in the future trajectories of dynamic obstacles. This planner addresses the particular problem of probabilistic collision avoidance for autonomous road vehicles that are required to safely interact, in close proximity, with other vehicles with unknown intentions. The presented path planner utilizes an efficient spline based trajectory representation and fast but accurate collision probability bounds to simultaneously optimize multiple continuous contingency paths in real-time. These collision probability bounds are efficient enough for real- time evaluation, yet accurate enough to allow for practical close- proximity driving behaviors such as passing an obstacle vehicle in an adjacent lane. An obstacle trajectory clustering algorithm is also presented to enable the path planner to scale to multiple- obstacle scenarios. Simulation results show that the contingency planner allows for a more aggressive driving style than non- contingency based approaches without compromising the overall safety of the robot.},

@article{Yiwen2014,
abstract = {A real-time scene modelling approach is presented that recognises temporary and permanent road structure change resulting from construction, accident or lane expansion and other obstructions. The system defined utilises a two-phase approach to modelling the scene. In the transitional phase, a dominant set-based graphical clustering approach is applied to understand the current scene structure from trajectory groupings, whereas the operational phase analyses the trajectories in real-time to detect anomalies such as u-turns, wrong-way or erratic drivers based on the acquired model of the scene structure and normal traffic patterns. In addition, the concept of dynamic traffic flow analysis is utilised to identify and remember temporary additions and removals of paths due to construction and accidents, as well as permanent road structure changes. An intuitive equal-arc-length sampling is applied to extract only the spatial information from the trajectory comparisons, since the spatial characteristics alone are sufficient for road structure understanding. A distance metric is developed to measure spatial difference and directional change of the path with entrance and exit awareness. Results for a publicly available dataset are provided, demonstrating that the method can efficiently model the scene, detect anomalies and capture both temporary and permanent scene reconstructions.},

abstract = { In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical clustering framework to classify vehicle motion trajectories in real traffic video based on their pairwise similarities. First raw trajectories are pre-processed and resampled at equal space intervals. Then spectral clustering is used to group trajectories with similar spatial patterns. Dominant paths and lanes can be distinguished as a result of two-layer hierarchical clustering. Detection of novel trajectories is also possible based on the clustering results. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of spectral clustering compared with conventional fuzzy K-means clustering and some results of anomaly detection are presented.},

@article{Melo2006,
abstract = {—Intelligent vision-based traffic surveillance systems are assuming an increasingly important role in highway moni- toring and road management schemes. This paper describes a low-level object tracking system that produces accurate vehicle motion trajectories that can be further analyzed to detect lane centers and classify lane types. Accompanying techniques for indexing and retrieval of anomalous trajectories are also derived. The predictive trajectory merge-and-split algorithm is used to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and incorporates a Kalman filter that is used to perform vehicle track- ing. The resulting motion trajectories are modeled using variable low-degree polynomials. A K-means clustering technique on the coefficient space can be used to obtain approximate lane centers. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes can be removed using robust estimation techniques based on Random SampleConsensus (RANSAC). Through the use of nonmetric distance functions and a simple directional indicator, highway lanes can be classified into one of the following categories: entry, exit, primary, or secondary. Experimental results are presented to show the real-time applica- tion of this approach to multiple views obtained by an uncalibrated pan–tilt–zoom traffic camera monitoring the junction of two busy intersecting highways},

@article{Jain2010,
abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},
